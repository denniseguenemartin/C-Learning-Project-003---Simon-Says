# C-Learning-Project-003---Simon-Says

# A Note About the Files
There were two attempts at this project contained in this repository. The first one I no longer have the complete version of the first attempt at this project and learning C++. I took a two year hiatus after learning some programming and to refresh myself I worked through my original projects. The revised attempt is that effort.

# Project Notes
This program takes two sets of user input in the form of numbers, stores in vectors and then compares the vectors, looking for duplicate characters and then
reports results.
